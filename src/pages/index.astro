          I work on data-heavy internal platforms where correctness matters: allocations, reporting, monthly workflows and production support.
          My day-to-day is a mix of backend development, query optimization, incident resolution, and automation.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          I build with C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core and SQL Server/Azure SQL, and I care a lot about maintainability:
          structured logging, validation, safe refactors, and predictable behavior under real-world constraints.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          I’m currently targeting fully remote backend roles in product teams where I can own features end-to-end and ship reliable systems.
